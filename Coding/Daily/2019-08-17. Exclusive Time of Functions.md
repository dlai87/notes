## 1116. Exclusive Time of Functions

Given the running logs of n functions that are executed in a nonpreemptive single threaded CPU, find the exclusive time of these functions.

Each function has a unique id, start from 0 to n-1. A function may be called recursively or by another function.

A log is a string has this format : `function_id:start_or_end:timestamp`. For example, `0:start:0` means function 0 starts from the very beginning of time 0. `0:end:0` means function 0 ends to the very end of time 0.

Exclusive time of a function is defined as the time spent within this function, the time spent by calling other functions should not be considered as this function's exclusive time. You should return the exclusive time of each function sorted by their function id.



这题思路比较直接，没用什么trick。 

逐行扫描， 分情况讨论， 一个stack

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param n: a integer
    @param logs: a list of integers
    @return: return a list of integers
    """
    def exclusiveTime(self, n, logs):
        counter = {}
        stack = [] 
        pre_timestamp = 0 
        for log in logs: 
            tokens = log.split(":")
            func_name = tokens[0]
            timestamp_type = tokens[1]
            timestamp = int(tokens[2])
            if timestamp_type == 'start':
                if len(stack) > 0 :
                    pre_func_name = stack[-1]
                    counter[pre_func_name] += (timestamp - pre_timestamp)
                stack.append(func_name)
                if func_name not in counter: 
                    counter[func_name] = 0 
                pre_timestamp = timestamp
            else:
                stack.pop()
                counter[func_name] += (timestamp - pre_timestamp + 1)
                pre_timestamp = timestamp + 1 

        result = [0] * len(counter)
        for key, value in counter.items():
            result[int(key)] = value
        return result

```
