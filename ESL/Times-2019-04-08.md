Theresa May made one last attempt to end that **paralysis** by promising to resign if Parliament would just push her deal **over the line**

+ Paralysis 无力的

+ Over the line 

  \1. Beyond what is considered appropriate or acceptable. *I know that it was a heated conversation,but you said a few things that were way too far over the line.* *I had to throw a few customers out of thebar because they had begun stepping over the line with the staff.*

  \2. Having a successful outcome, but only by a narrow margin. *The last-minute goal got ManchesterUnited over the line for a place in the finals.*

  

Hundreds of thousands of people who lined the streets of …. looked like a **colony of ants**

May **staked** her reputation on delevering Brexit 

+ stake 支撑；押注

  He has staked his political future on an election victory

  I staked ten dollar upon a horse, and it won

she's been unable to count on the support of even people who want to leave, **let alone** those who don't
